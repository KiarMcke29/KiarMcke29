  Hi, I’m <b>Kiara Mckenzie</b> and I'm passionate about designing and developing user interfaces. I’m interested in creating beautiful interactive sites that'll be difficult to look away from!
  Some of the technologies I use to build are HTML, CSS, SCSS/SASS, Javascript ,and Bootstrap. I’m currently learning React to level up in my skills as a Front-End Developer.
